# A Collection of 8 Data Science Projects for Beginners.

This repository consists of 8 fun Machine Learning related projects.
Each project is deals with some of the most important concepts of Machine Learning.

The objective of these projects is to have,
1) Train Deep Learning techniques to perform image classification tasks.

2) Develop prediction models to forecast future events such as future commodity prices using state of the art Facebook Prophet Time series.

3) Develop Natural Language Processing Models to analyze customer reviews and identify spam/ham messages.

4) Develop recommender systems such as Amazon and Netflix movie recommender systems.
